 - HTML
 - CSS
 - Javascript

## Instructions

### HTML
 - Open index.html in your browser. Right click and select 'Inspect': try hovering over various pieces of the page. What happens if you click on an area? Try messing around with the code that you see when you're in this browser mode. Try making changes, and then refresh the page.
 - Open index.html in an editor. Make the title (what appears at the top tab in the browser) say something besides Hello World
 - Change the 'Hi!' greeting
 - Change the text on the button

### CSS
 - How does our HTML know that it should use our CSS file?
 - Change the page background color

## JavaScript
 - How does our HTML know that it should use our JavaScript file?
 - How would we add another JavaScript file?
 - There's a partially completed function in our JavaScript file: try editing it so that when you click the button, the text from the input field appears in thearea of the page that currently says 'Put content here'
